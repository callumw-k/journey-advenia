      <p>
        The land of Advenia is as beautiful as it is dangerous, and for young
        monk Kiro, it is a world he has never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasked with travelling to the end of the world, he meets a fugitive
        swordswoman and a legendary bounty hunter. Forming an unlikely trio, the
        group journey for the capital city, where their greatest enemy awaits
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        With vast, wondrous, and treacherous lands before them, Kiro will come
        to face many grim realities, and in his search for the ultimate truth,
        question everything he ever knew.
